# A join combines two or more tables to retrieve data from multiple tables
# INNER JOIN: Returns all rows when there is at least one match in BOTH tables
# Outer JOIN : 
# 	LEFT JOIN: Return all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table
# 	RIGHT JOIN: Return all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table
# 	FULL JOIN: Return all rows when there is a match in ONE of the tables
#   LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN are shorthand for LEFT OUTER JOIN and RIGHT OUTER JOIN
