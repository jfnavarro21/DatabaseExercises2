The difference between the WHERE & HAVING is in the relationship to the GROUP BY clause:
- WHERE comes before GROUP BY; SQL evaluates the WHERE clause before it groups records.
- HAVING comes after GROUP BY; SQL evaluates HAVING after it groups records.
- HAVING clause applies the filter condition to each group of rows, while the WHERE 
  clause applies the filter condition to each individual row.
