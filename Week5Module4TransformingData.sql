################### Conversions functions ###################
# Conversion functions are used to convert a data type into another data type

# MySQL converts a string into an integer implicitly before calculation:
SELECT (1 + '1')/2;

# Explicit cast
SELECT (1 + CAST('1' AS UNSIGNED))/2 ;

# phone is varchar(50) and when cast to unsigned integer we have erroneous results 
DESCRIBE offices;

# The data type of the requireDate column is DATE, therefore, MySQL has to convert the literal strings: '2015-01-01' and '2015-01-31' into TIMESTAMP values before evaluating the WHERE condition.
SELECT 
    orderNumber, requiredDate
FROM
    orders
WHERE
    requiredDate BETWEEN '2015-01-01' AND '2015-01-31';

# To be safe, you can use CAST() function to explicitly convert a string into a TIMESTAMP value as follows: 
SELECT 
    orderNumber, requiredDate
FROM
    orders
WHERE
    requiredDate BETWEEN CAST('2015-01-01' AS DATETIME) AND CAST('2015-01-31' AS DATETIME);

# converts DOUBLE values into CHAR values and uses the results as the arguments to CONCAT function
